# Typescript QuickStart

Follow these steps to use the Pieces Typescript SDK.

## Download Pieces OS

:::info

You must either have Pieces OS installed on your local machine or have access to a remote instance of Pieces OS to use this SDK.

:::

Download [**Pieces OS**](/installation-getting-started/pieces-os) for your operating system:

- [**macOS**](/installation-getting-started/macos)
- [**Windows**](/installation-getting-started/windows)
- [**Linux**](/installation-getting-started/linux)

## Install Typescript SDK

Use `npm` to install the Pieces Typescript SDK using the following command:

```sh
npm install @pieces.app/pieces-os-client
```

Or use `pnpm` to install the Pieces Typescript SDK using the following command:

```sh
pnpm add @pieces.app/pieces-os-client
```

Or use `yarn` to install the Pieces Typescript SDK using the following command:

```sh
yarn add @pieces.app/pieces-os-client
```

:::info

The order in which npm packages are saved and added to your dependencies is important and will affect your installation flow.

If you are having issues with your installation, it is likely due to a conflict in Typescript versions. Run `npm uninstall typescript` and then go back and perform all other npm installations before reinstalling typescript.

:::

## Initialize SDK

After installing the SDK, you must initialize the SDK with your base URL. The base URL will depend on your setup.

If you are using a local instance of Pieces OS:
- On macOS/Windows, use http://localhost:1000
- On Linux, use http://localhost:5323

If you are using a remote instance of Pieces OS, use the URL you have set up for that.

## Getting started

Create a Typescript script to test the connection to the Pieces OS server. Create a `main.ts` file to test the connection.

```typescript
// const pieces = require('@pieces.app/pieces-os-client'); // can import library using require
import * as pieces from '@pieces.app/pieces-os-client'; // can import library using import
import os from 'os';

const platform = os.platform();
let port = 1000;

// Defining the port based on the operating system. For Linux, the port is 5323, and for macOS/Windows, the port is 1000.
if (platform === 'linux') {
  port = 5323;
} else {
  port = 1000;
}

// The `hostPath` defaults to http://localhost:1000, however we need to change it to the correct port based on the operating system.
const configuration = Pieces.Configuration({
  hostPath: `http://localhost:${port}`
})
// Create an instance of the WellKnownApi class
const apiInstance = new Pieces.WellKnownApi(configuration)

apiInstance.getWellKnownHealth().then((data: string) => {
  console.log(data) // ok
}).catch((error: unknown) => console.error(error))
```

In the code snippet above, we use the platform package to determine the base URL based on the operating system.

Run the following command to execute the script:

```sh
ts-node main.ts
```
